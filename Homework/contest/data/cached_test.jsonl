Despite its potential in generating continuous embeddings for various networks, both the effectiveness and efficiency to infer highquality representations toward large corpus of nodes are still challenging. Sampling is a critical point to achieve the performance goals. Prior arts usually focus on sampling positive node pairs, while the strategy for negative sampling is left insufficiently explored. To bridge the gap, we systematically analyze the role of negative sampling from the perspectives of both objective and risk, theoretically demonstrating that negative sampling is as important as positive sampling in determining the optimization objective and the resulted variance.", "features": [759, 0, 0, 0, 0.7452829485582124, 6.084905086329709, 0.3679244935920289, 21.1999576000848, 0.011857707353653395, 14.520773584905669, 0.3018867639729468, 0.12264149786400963, 0.12264149786400963, 0.06603772961908211]}
